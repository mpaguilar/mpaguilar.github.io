      <description>&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s been a lot of noise about AI replacing developers. Spoiler: it won&amp;rsquo;t. But your job is changing in ways nobody&amp;rsquo;s really talking about.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>AI Doesn&#39;t Eliminate Jobs, It Changes Them</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;AI isn&amp;rsquo;t going to take your job, it&amp;rsquo;s going to &lt;em&gt;change&lt;/em&gt; your job. There are things you do as part of your job now which will go away, but new parts will be added.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently built a production-ready application entirely with AI assistance, 100% written by the AI - not as a proof-of-concept, but as a functional tool designed to solve complex workflow problems.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;rsquo;t magic, it was work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>AI development: the good and bad</title>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;AI-assisted development accelerates both coding speed and error propagation, with risks like cascading mistakes and design flaws magnified by AI&amp;rsquo;s context limitations, akin to Knight Capital&amp;rsquo;s $500M human-error-driven collapse.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Real-world failures (e.g., Knight Capital) stem from process gaps, not technology; AI intensifies this by compressing multi-year human error patterns - like developers Alice, Bob, and Charlie inheriting undocumented code under time pressure - into hours or days.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;AI lacks persistent context, acting as a &amp;ldquo;new developer&amp;rdquo; per request, which forgets safeguards, amplifies poor documentation, and misses architectural pitfalls unless explicitly guided by experienced oversight.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Defensive coding practices (e.g., explicit error checks, copy-before-move for files) are critical since AI won&amp;rsquo;t self-advocate for safeguards - users must enforce quality control as architects and reviewers.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;While AI democratizes development, inexperienced users often overlook foundational pitfalls, making seasoned judgment essential to prevent small oversights from escalating at machine speed.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>
