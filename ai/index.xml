      <description>&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s say you have a problem, and you&amp;rsquo;re pretty sure that writing an app is the solution. Maybe you want a basic inventory system for your small business. Or maybe you have a small piece of a large legacy system that needs upgrading. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter what it is.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You have a problem, you want software, and you want to make the most of agentic development.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-problem-with-vibe-planning&#34;&gt;The Problem with &amp;ldquo;Vibe-Planning&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The impulse is to just start chatting with an AI. You describe your problem, the AI suggests something, you correct it, it suggests something else, and you keep going back and forth until you have what &lt;em&gt;seems&lt;/em&gt; like a solid plan.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is &amp;ldquo;vibe-planning.&amp;rdquo; It feels productive, but it has a major flaw. The result is what &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; think is a good plan, which may or may not actually be a good plan. An AI will happily follow you down a bad path if you lead it there.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a better way. The cool kids are calling it &amp;ldquo;Research, Plan, and Implement&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Disappearance of the Entry-Level Job</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The headlines are terrifying. Every day seems to bring another story about how AI is going to wipe out entire categories of jobs. &amp;ldquo;The Disappearance of the Entry-Level Job&amp;rdquo; is a popular one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These articles paint a grim picture of a world with no starting point for a career.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Like most things, the truth is somewhere in-between. While it&amp;rsquo;s true that many familiar junior-level positions are being changed or eliminated, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean there are no junior-level positions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Say it with me: &amp;ldquo;the jobs will change&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>AI and the Hiring Landscape</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot of chatter about AI reshaping hiring, but it’s not as simple as “replace recruiters” or “solve everything.” The impact depends on how it’s trained, how it’s prompted, and how it’s used. It could streamline things or make them worse, depending on the setup.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>It Sucks Being a Manager</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve written quite a bit about the overall process of AI-assisted development. Not the &amp;ldquo;write code&amp;rdquo; part of it - if anything, that&amp;rsquo;s the easy part. There&amp;rsquo;s a process to writing a project which can be maintained, with bug fixes and new features.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s a little tough right now is constantly being in the position of being a manager, stakeholder, business, and end-user. I&amp;rsquo;ve understood it in an abstract, and tend to be careful about considering them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s so very &lt;em&gt;visceral&lt;/em&gt; now.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Which AI Model Should I Use For Coding?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Most of the big players (Anthropic, Google, et. al) provide all-in-one solutions for writing code. If that&amp;rsquo;s what you&amp;rsquo;re doing, that&amp;rsquo;s fine, but you may be missing out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For one thing, they can be pretty expensive (unless your company is paying for it). Anthropic&amp;rsquo;s best - Opus - can get really expensive, really fast. Admittedly, it still costs less than paying for an overseas team, but if it&amp;rsquo;s coming out of your wallet you&amp;rsquo;re bound to notice.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Considering how quickly everything is moving, I&amp;rsquo;m sure this post will age like milk.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Advanced AI Code Automation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, you&amp;rsquo;ve got a great process down for developing your code. You&amp;rsquo;ve got great documentation, 100% test coverage, good git branching and tagging, and all the other detailed steps for generating code.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It sure is a lot of typing, though, isn&amp;rsquo;t it? Very repititious. Obviously, you should automate those steps! You&amp;rsquo;re only a little bit away from typing in &amp;ldquo;Write me an app that does X,Y, and Z!&amp;rdquo; and then taking a nap while it does the work!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Not so fast&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>&#34;AI is a bubble!&#34; Yea, So What?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;AI is just a bubble!&amp;rdquo; Yep, sure is. So what? That&amp;rsquo;s no reason to ignore it, or to brush it off as a fad. While nobody can be 100% sure exactly how it will make the world look in five years, you can be sure the world will look different.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Calling something a &amp;ldquo;bubble&amp;rdquo; is often a way to dismiss it. But history shows that even when a bubble pops, the underlying technology doesn&amp;rsquo;t just go away. It sticks around and changes everything.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How AI will change a developer&#39;s job</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s been a lot of noise about AI replacing developers. Spoiler: it won&amp;rsquo;t. But your job is changing in ways nobody&amp;rsquo;s really talking about.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>AI Doesn&#39;t Eliminate Jobs, It Changes Them</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;AI isn&amp;rsquo;t going to take your job, it&amp;rsquo;s going to &lt;em&gt;change&lt;/em&gt; your job. There are things you do as part of your job now which will go away, but new parts will be added.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently built a production-ready application entirely with AI assistance, 100% written by the AI - not as a proof-of-concept, but as a functional tool designed to solve complex workflow problems.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;rsquo;t magic, it was work.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; The application code is now over 3500 lines of code, plus 883 tests giving 100% coverage including branches. I have written zero lines.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>AI development: the good and bad</title>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;AI-assisted development accelerates both coding speed and error propagation, with risks like cascading mistakes and design flaws magnified by AI&amp;rsquo;s context limitations, akin to Knight Capital&amp;rsquo;s $500M human-error-driven collapse.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Real-world failures (e.g., Knight Capital) stem from process gaps, not technology; AI intensifies this by compressing multi-year human error patterns - like developers Alice, Bob, and Charlie inheriting undocumented code under time pressure - into hours or days.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;AI lacks persistent context, acting as a &amp;ldquo;new developer&amp;rdquo; per request, which forgets safeguards, amplifies poor documentation, and misses architectural pitfalls unless explicitly guided by experienced oversight.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Defensive coding practices (e.g., explicit error checks, copy-before-move for files) are critical since AI won&amp;rsquo;t self-advocate for safeguards - users must enforce quality control as architects and reviewers.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;While AI democratizes development, inexperienced users often overlook foundational pitfalls, making seasoned judgment essential to prevent small oversights from escalating at machine speed.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>
