      <title>It Sucks Being a Manager</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve written quite a bit about the overall process of AI-assisted development. Not the &amp;ldquo;write code&amp;rdquo; part of it - if anything, that&amp;rsquo;s the easy part. There&amp;rsquo;s a process to writing a project which can be maintained, with bug fixes and new features.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s a little tough right now is constantly being in the position of being a manager, stakeholder, business, and end-user. I&amp;rsquo;ve understood it in an abstract, and tend to be careful about considering them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s so very &lt;em&gt;visceral&lt;/em&gt; now.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Which AI Model Should I Use For Coding?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Most of the big players (Anthropic, Google, et. al) provide all-in-one solutions for writing code. If that&amp;rsquo;s what you&amp;rsquo;re doing, that&amp;rsquo;s fine, but you may be missing out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For one thing, they can be pretty expensive (unless your company is paying for it). Anthropic&amp;rsquo;s best - Opus - can get really expensive, really fast. Admittedly, it still costs less than paying for an overseas team, but if it&amp;rsquo;s coming out of your wallet you&amp;rsquo;re bound to notice.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Considering how quickly everything is moving, I&amp;rsquo;m sure this post will age like milk.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Advanced AI Code Automation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, you&amp;rsquo;ve got a great process down for developing your code. You&amp;rsquo;ve got great documentation, 100% test coverage, good git branching and tagging, and all the other detailed steps for generating code.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It sure is a lot of typing, though, isn&amp;rsquo;t it? Very repititious. Obviously, you should automate those steps! You&amp;rsquo;re only a little bit away from typing in &amp;ldquo;Write me an app that does X,Y, and Z!&amp;rdquo; and then taking a nap while it does the work!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Not so fast&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>&#34;AI is a bubble!&#34; Yea, So What?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;AI is just a bubble!&amp;rdquo; Yep, sure is. So what? That&amp;rsquo;s no reason to ignore it, or to brush it off as a fad. While nobody can be 100% sure exactly how it will make the world look in five years, you can be sure the world will look different.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Calling something a &amp;ldquo;bubble&amp;rdquo; is often a way to dismiss it. But history shows that even when a bubble pops, the underlying technology doesn&amp;rsquo;t just go away. It sticks around and changes everything.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How AI will change a developer&#39;s job</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s been a lot of noise about AI replacing developers. Spoiler: it won&amp;rsquo;t. But your job is changing in ways nobody&amp;rsquo;s really talking about.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>AI Doesn&#39;t Eliminate Jobs, It Changes Them</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;AI isn&amp;rsquo;t going to take your job, it&amp;rsquo;s going to &lt;em&gt;change&lt;/em&gt; your job. There are things you do as part of your job now which will go away, but new parts will be added.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Reliably Building AI Systems</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently built a production-ready application entirely with AI assistance, 100% written by the AI - not as a proof-of-concept, but as a functional tool designed to solve complex workflow problems.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;rsquo;t magic, it was work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>AI development: the good and bad</title>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;AI-assisted development accelerates both coding speed and error propagation, with risks like cascading mistakes and design flaws magnified by AI&amp;rsquo;s context limitations, akin to Knight Capital&amp;rsquo;s $500M human-error-driven collapse.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Real-world failures (e.g., Knight Capital) stem from process gaps, not technology; AI intensifies this by compressing multi-year human error patterns - like developers Alice, Bob, and Charlie inheriting undocumented code under time pressure - into hours or days.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;AI lacks persistent context, acting as a &amp;ldquo;new developer&amp;rdquo; per request, which forgets safeguards, amplifies poor documentation, and misses architectural pitfalls unless explicitly guided by experienced oversight.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Defensive coding practices (e.g., explicit error checks, copy-before-move for files) are critical since AI won&amp;rsquo;t self-advocate for safeguards - users must enforce quality control as architects and reviewers.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;While AI democratizes development, inexperienced users often overlook foundational pitfalls, making seasoned judgment essential to prevent small oversights from escalating at machine speed.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>
