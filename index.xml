      <title>AI Doesn&#39;t Eliminate Jobs, It Changes Them</title>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;AI is not eliminating jobs but transforming them, similar to how spreadsheets changed accounting practices.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many tedious tasks (e.g., formatting resumes, data entry) are being automated by AI, allowing workers to focus on more valuable aspects of their roles.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As mundane tasks are automated, the remaining work becomes more valuable, emphasizing original thought, creativity, and complex decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A marketing professional can now use AI to generate design options quickly, allowing them to focus on creative elements and strategy rather than repetitive tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Professionals who do not adapt to using AI tools will fall behind competitors who leverage AI for efficiency and strategic focus.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;AI is here to take over time-consuming tasks, enabling workers to engage in more meaningful work. Success will depend on the ability to adapt and embrace these tools.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

      <title>Reliably Building AI Systems</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently built a production-ready application entirely with AI assistance, 100% written by the AI - not as a proof-of-concept, but as a functional tool designed to solve complex workflow problems.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;rsquo;t magic, it was work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>AI development: the good and bad</title>
      <link>https://michael-aguilar.com/ai/ai-development-good-and-bad/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 02 Aug 2025 09:44:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;AI-assisted development accelerates both coding speed and error propagation, with risks like cascading mistakes and design flaws magnified by AI&amp;rsquo;s context limitations, akin to Knight Capital&amp;rsquo;s $500M human-error-driven collapse.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Real-world failures (e.g., Knight Capital) stem from process gaps, not technology; AI intensifies this by compressing multi-year human error patterns—like developers Alice, Bob, and Charlie inheriting undocumented code under time pressure—into hours or days.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;AI lacks persistent context, acting as a &amp;ldquo;new developer&amp;rdquo; per request, which forgets safeguards, amplifies poor documentation, and misses architectural pitfalls unless explicitly guided by experienced oversight.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Defensive coding practices (e.g., explicit error checks, copy-before-move for files) are critical since AI won&amp;rsquo;t self-advocate for safeguards—users must enforce quality control as architects and reviewers.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;While AI democratizes development, inexperienced users often overlook foundational pitfalls, making seasoned judgment essential to prevent small oversights from escalating at machine speed.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

      <title>Hiring Managers</title>
      <link>https://michael-aguilar.com/job-hunting/job-hunting-and-the-hiring-manager/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It all starts with the hiring manager. They have an opening, and they need to find some candidates.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The hiring manager will create a job description, and send it to a recruiter. In a larger organization, HR will play a big part in this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;They&amp;rsquo;re also very involved at the end. They have the final say as to whether or not a candidate is selected. Don&amp;rsquo;t blame the recruiter - they didn&amp;rsquo;t have anything to do with it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The problem with hiring managers:&lt;/strong&gt; Most managers don&amp;rsquo;t know anything about hiring people. For many, it&amp;rsquo;s something they do once or twice a year, if that often.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Recruiters</title>
      <link>https://michael-aguilar.com/job-hunting/job-hunting-and-recruiters/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The recruiter will take the job description and post it somewhere. They may do it themselves, and/or send it to one or more third-party agencies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s important to note that recruiters are paid to place people into jobs. If they don&amp;rsquo;t find someone, they don&amp;rsquo;t get paid.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;They have a lot of incentive to find someone &lt;em&gt;the hiring manager will accept&lt;/em&gt;. Not necessarily the best candidate, but the one that will get them paid the most money for the least effort.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The problem with recruiters:&lt;/strong&gt; They&amp;rsquo;re all different. They all have their own way of evaluating candidates. Ask three recruiters what&amp;rsquo;s the best way to get a job, and you&amp;rsquo;ll get four answers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>AI Generated Resumes</title>
      <link>https://michael-aguilar.com/job-hunting/job-hunting-and-ai-generated-resumes/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you apply on LinkedIn, you may see that a given job has &amp;ldquo;100+&amp;rdquo; applicants in less than a day. That&amp;rsquo;s not a mistake, or a typo.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Just because you see so many applicants doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t apply if you&amp;rsquo;re qualified. You should.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Adding to the difficulty is that many of those 100+ applicants are faking it. It isn&amp;rsquo;t difficult to create a resume based on the job description. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to apply, so plenty of unqualified people just go for it. The potential  of getting a job is a huge reward for very little effort.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The problem with AI Generated resumes:&lt;/strong&gt; With the popularization of AI, creating and submitting a tailored resume is easier than ever. It will be perfectly formatted, have relevant bullet points, and follow the STAR method.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Automatic Tracking System</title>
      <link>https://michael-aguilar.com/job-hunting/job-hunting-and-the-automatic-tracking-system/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;An applicant will submit their resume, and it will be parsed - with varying results - into an Automatic Tracking System. Job descriptions, dates, and keywords will be added to various fields in a database.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Recruiters seldom read every resume that comes in. Some still do, but given how many applications they receive it&amp;rsquo;s become even less common.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The problem with the ATS:&lt;/strong&gt; When a recruiter queries the ATS, they look for keywords, and get back a list of applications with a score. If an applicant&amp;rsquo;s keywords don&amp;rsquo;t line up, then they get a lower score. They won&amp;rsquo;t be rejected. They won&amp;rsquo;t even be considered.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Are you curious about how AI can enhance your work, but feel overwhelmed by the technical jargon? If so, you’re in the right place!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When you last interacted with AI, did it seem like a mysterious magic box, or did you feel empowered to mold it to your needs?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this primer, we&amp;rsquo;re going to remove the magic, and help you understand it as a tool you can manipulate.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
