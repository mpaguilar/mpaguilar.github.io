      <description>&lt;p&gt;Right now, the job market is really difficult. It&amp;rsquo;s tough for everyone working white-collar jobs, but it&amp;rsquo;s especially bad for new grads, or those with limited experience.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a very frustrating experience.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s clarify who is actually making the hiring decision and why you may not make it past each stage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Are you curious about how AI can enhance your work, but feel overwhelmed by the technical jargon? If so, you’re in the right place!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When you last interacted with AI, did it seem like a mysterious magic box, or did you feel empowered to mold it to your needs?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this primer, we&amp;rsquo;re going to remove the magic, and help you understand it as a tool you can manipulate.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ever wonder why AI sometimes acts like your chatty friend and other times like a stiff librarian? The difference often comes down to two invisible ingredients: the system prompt and your user prompt. Let’s peel back the curtain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Automatic Tracking System</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;An applicant will submit their resume, and it will be parsed - with varying results - into an Automatic Tracking System. Job descriptions, dates, and keywords will be added to various fields in a database.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Recruiters seldom read every resume that comes in. Some still do, but given how many applications they receive it&amp;rsquo;s become even less common.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The problem with the ATS:&lt;/strong&gt; When a recruiter queries the ATS, they look for keywords, and get back a list of applications with a score. If an applicant&amp;rsquo;s keywords don&amp;rsquo;t line up, then they get a lower score. They won&amp;rsquo;t be rejected. They won&amp;rsquo;t even be considered.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The recruiter will take the job description and post it somewhere. They may do it themselves, and/or send it to one or more third-party agencies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s important to note that recruiters are paid to place people into jobs. If they don&amp;rsquo;t find someone, they don&amp;rsquo;t get paid.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;They have a lot of incentive to find someone &lt;em&gt;the hiring manager will accept&lt;/em&gt;. Not necessarily the best candidate, but the one that will get them paid the most money for the least effort.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The problem with recruiters:&lt;/strong&gt; They&amp;rsquo;re all different. They all have their own way of evaluating candidates. Ask three recruiters what&amp;rsquo;s the best way to get a job, and you&amp;rsquo;ll get five answers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Hiring Managers</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It all starts with the hiring manager. They have an opening, and they need to find some candidates.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The hiring manager will create a job description, and send it to a recruiter. In a larger organization, HR will play a big part in this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;They&amp;rsquo;re also very involved at the end. They have the final say as to whether or not a candidate is selected. Don&amp;rsquo;t blame the recruiter - they didn&amp;rsquo;t have anything to do with it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The problem with hiring managers:&lt;/strong&gt; For many, it&amp;rsquo;s something they do once or twice a year, if that often. They&amp;rsquo;re already overworked, and interviewing adds even more.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One or more interviews will be with your future co-workers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These interviews have a lot of impact on whether or not you&amp;rsquo;ll be hired. They aren&amp;rsquo;t always make-or-break, but the hiring manager will take their feedback very seriously.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The questions are usually technical in nature: &amp;ldquo;describe what a load balancer does&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;what does it mean when you get this error?&amp;rdquo;, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You may even get a curveball, like &amp;ldquo;tell me about a time you had to give bad news to your boss&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Congratulations! You were offered the job! Now you can finally stop scouring job boards, filling out endless applications, hovering over your email, interviewing, and basically just stop worrying. What a relief!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An offer is a great step forward, but it isn&amp;rsquo;t the finish line. A lot can happen between &amp;ldquo;we&amp;rsquo;d like to hire you&amp;rdquo; and your first paycheck clearing the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The problem with getting an offer:&lt;/strong&gt; It&amp;rsquo;s only an &lt;em&gt;offer&lt;/em&gt;. There may still be reasons you don&amp;rsquo;t have a new job.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Applying for jobs is a numbers game. You send out resumes, cross your fingers, and hope something sticks. Sometimes it does. More often, it doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You might get a polite rejection email.&#xA;You might get ghosted completely.&#xA;You might make it through three rounds of interviews only to vanish into the void.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That’s just how it is.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you apply on LinkedIn, you may see that a given job has “100+” applicants in less than a day. That’s not a mistake, or a typo.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Just because you see so many applicants doesn’t mean you shouldn’t apply if you’re qualified. You should.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Adding to the difficulty is that many of those 100+ applicants are faking it. It isn’t difficult to create a resume based on the job description. It’s easy to apply, so plenty of unqualified people just go for it. The potential of getting a job is a huge reward for very little effort.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The problem with AI Generated resumes:&lt;/strong&gt; With the popularization of AI, creating and submitting a tailored resume is easier than ever. It will be perfectly formatted, have relevant bullet points, and follow the STAR method.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Interviewing Using AI Is Not Cheating</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of complaining about candidates using AI during coding interviews. They say it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;cheating&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No, it&amp;rsquo;s not.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Using AI during an interview should be expected and encouraged. The goal of an interview isn&amp;rsquo;t to see if a candidate can pass a test. The goal is to figure out how well they would do the job.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This article talks about writing code, but the idea applies to just about any knowledge-focused job.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s say you have a problem, and you&amp;rsquo;re pretty sure that writing an app is the solution. Maybe you want a basic inventory system for your small business. Or maybe you have a small piece of a large legacy system that needs upgrading. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter what it is.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You have a problem, you want software, and you want to make the most of agentic development.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-problem-with-vibe-planning&#34;&gt;The Problem with &amp;ldquo;Vibe-Planning&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The impulse is to just start chatting with an AI. You describe your problem, the AI suggests something, you correct it, it suggests something else, and you keep going back and forth until you have what &lt;em&gt;seems&lt;/em&gt; like a solid plan.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is &amp;ldquo;vibe-planning.&amp;rdquo; It feels productive, but it has a major flaw. The result is what &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; think is a good plan, which may or may not actually be a good plan. An AI will happily follow you down a bad path if you lead it there.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a better way. The cool kids are calling it &amp;ldquo;Research, Plan, and Implement&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The headlines are terrifying. Every day seems to bring another story about how AI is going to wipe out entire categories of jobs. &amp;ldquo;The Disappearance of the Entry-Level Job&amp;rdquo; is a popular one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These articles paint a grim picture of a world with no starting point for a career.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Like most things, the truth is somewhere in-between. While it&amp;rsquo;s true that many familiar junior-level positions are being changed or eliminated, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean there are no junior-level positions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Say it with me: &amp;ldquo;the jobs will change&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot of chatter about AI reshaping hiring, but it’s not as simple as “replace recruiters” or “solve everything.” The impact depends on how it’s trained, how it’s prompted, and how it’s used. It could streamline things or make them worse, depending on the setup.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve written quite a bit about the overall process of AI-assisted development. Not the &amp;ldquo;write code&amp;rdquo; part of it - if anything, that&amp;rsquo;s the easy part. There&amp;rsquo;s a process to writing a project which can be maintained, with bug fixes and new features.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s a little tough right now is constantly being in the position of being a manager, stakeholder, business, and end-user. I&amp;rsquo;ve understood it in an abstract, and tend to be careful about considering them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s so very &lt;em&gt;visceral&lt;/em&gt; now.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Which AI Model Should I Use For Coding?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Most of the big players (Anthropic, Google, et. al) provide all-in-one solutions for writing code. If that&amp;rsquo;s what you&amp;rsquo;re doing, that&amp;rsquo;s fine, but you may be missing out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For one thing, they can be pretty expensive (unless your company is paying for it). Anthropic&amp;rsquo;s best - Opus - can get really expensive, really fast. Admittedly, it still costs less than paying for an overseas team, but if it&amp;rsquo;s coming out of your wallet you&amp;rsquo;re bound to notice.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Considering how quickly everything is moving, I&amp;rsquo;m sure this post will age like milk.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, you&amp;rsquo;ve got a great process down for developing your code. You&amp;rsquo;ve got great documentation, 100% test coverage, good git branching and tagging, and all the other detailed steps for generating code.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It sure is a lot of typing, though, isn&amp;rsquo;t it? Very repititious. Obviously, you should automate those steps! You&amp;rsquo;re only a little bit away from typing in &amp;ldquo;Write me an app that does X,Y, and Z!&amp;rdquo; and then taking a nap while it does the work!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Not so fast&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;AI is just a bubble!&amp;rdquo; Yep, sure is. So what? That&amp;rsquo;s no reason to ignore it, or to brush it off as a fad. While nobody can be 100% sure exactly how it will make the world look in five years, you can be sure the world will look different.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Calling something a &amp;ldquo;bubble&amp;rdquo; is often a way to dismiss it. But history shows that even when a bubble pops, the underlying technology doesn&amp;rsquo;t just go away. It sticks around and changes everything.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently built a production-ready application entirely with AI assistance, 100% written by the AI - not as a proof-of-concept, but as a functional tool designed to solve complex workflow problems.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;rsquo;t magic, it was work.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; The application code is now over 5,600 lines of code, plus 16,000 lines of code in 883 tests giving 100% coverage including branches.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;AI-assisted development accelerates both coding speed and error propagation, with risks like cascading mistakes and design flaws magnified by AI&amp;rsquo;s context limitations, akin to Knight Capital&amp;rsquo;s $500M human-error-driven collapse.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Real-world failures (e.g., Knight Capital) stem from process gaps, not technology; AI intensifies this by compressing multi-year human error patterns - like developers Alice, Bob, and Charlie inheriting undocumented code under time pressure - into hours or days.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;AI lacks persistent context, acting as a &amp;ldquo;new developer&amp;rdquo; per request, which forgets safeguards, amplifies poor documentation, and misses architectural pitfalls unless explicitly guided by experienced oversight.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Defensive coding practices (e.g., explicit error checks, copy-before-move for files) are critical since AI won&amp;rsquo;t self-advocate for safeguards - users must enforce quality control as architects and reviewers.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;While AI democratizes development, inexperienced users often overlook foundational pitfalls, making seasoned judgment essential to prevent small oversights from escalating at machine speed.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>
