      <description>&lt;p&gt;Right now, the job market is really difficult. It&amp;rsquo;s tough for everyone working white-collar jobs, but it&amp;rsquo;s especially bad for new grads, or those with limited experience.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a very frustrating experience.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s clarify who is actually making the hiring decision and why you may not make it past each stage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Are you curious about how AI can enhance your work, but feel overwhelmed by the technical jargon? If so, you’re in the right place!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When you last interacted with AI, did it seem like a mysterious magic box, or did you feel empowered to mold it to your needs?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this primer, we&amp;rsquo;re going to remove the magic, and help you understand it as a tool you can manipulate.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ever feel like you&amp;rsquo;re whispering into a megaphone when talking to AI? You&amp;rsquo;re not alone - and the fix is simpler than you think.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ever wonder why AI sometimes acts like your chatty friend and other times like a stiff librarian? The difference often comes down to two invisible ingredients: the system prompt and your user prompt. Let’s peel back the curtain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Automatic Tracking System</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;An applicant will submit their resume, and it will be parsed - with varying results - into an Automatic Tracking System. Job descriptions, dates, and keywords will be added to various fields in a database.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Recruiters seldom read every resume that comes in. Some still do, but given how many applications they receive it&amp;rsquo;s become even less common.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The problem with the ATS:&lt;/strong&gt; When a recruiter queries the ATS, they look for keywords, and get back a list of applications with a score. If an applicant&amp;rsquo;s keywords don&amp;rsquo;t line up, then they get a lower score. They won&amp;rsquo;t be rejected. They won&amp;rsquo;t even be considered.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The recruiter will take the job description and post it somewhere. They may do it themselves, and/or send it to one or more third-party agencies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s important to note that recruiters are paid to place people into jobs. If they don&amp;rsquo;t find someone, they don&amp;rsquo;t get paid.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;They have a lot of incentive to find someone &lt;em&gt;the hiring manager will accept&lt;/em&gt;. Not necessarily the best candidate, but the one that will get them paid the most money for the least effort.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The problem with recruiters:&lt;/strong&gt; They&amp;rsquo;re all different. They all have their own way of evaluating candidates. Ask three recruiters what&amp;rsquo;s the best way to get a job, and you&amp;rsquo;ll get five answers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Hiring Managers</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It all starts with the hiring manager. They have an opening, and they need to find some candidates.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The hiring manager will create a job description, and send it to a recruiter. In a larger organization, HR will play a big part in this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;They&amp;rsquo;re also very involved at the end. They have the final say as to whether or not a candidate is selected. Don&amp;rsquo;t blame the recruiter - they didn&amp;rsquo;t have anything to do with it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The problem with hiring managers:&lt;/strong&gt; For many, it&amp;rsquo;s something they do once or twice a year, if that often. They&amp;rsquo;re already overworked, and interviewing adds even more.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Team Interview</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One or more interviews will be with your future co-workers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These interviews have a lot of impact on whether or not you&amp;rsquo;ll be hired. They aren&amp;rsquo;t always make-or-break, but the hiring manager will take their feedback very seriously.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The questions are usually technical in nature: &amp;ldquo;describe what a load balancer does&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;what does it mean when you get this error?&amp;rdquo;, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You may even get a curveball, like &amp;ldquo;tell me about a time you had to give bad news to your boss&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Congratulations! You were offered the job! Now you can finally scouring job boards, filling out endless applications, hovering over your email, interviewing, and basically just stop worrying. What a relief!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An offer is a great step forward, but it isn&amp;rsquo;t the finish line. A lot can happen between &amp;ldquo;we&amp;rsquo;d like to hire you&amp;rdquo; and your first paycheck clearing the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The problem with getting an offer:&lt;/strong&gt; It&amp;rsquo;s only an &lt;em&gt;offer&lt;/em&gt;. There may still be reasons you don&amp;rsquo;t have a new job.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Being rejected for a position</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Applying for jobs is a numbers game. You send out resumes, cross your fingers, and hope something sticks. Sometimes it does. More often, it doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You might get a polite rejection email.&#xA;You might get ghosted completely.&#xA;You might make it through three rounds of interviews only to vanish into the void.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That’s just how it is.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>AI Generated Resumes</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you apply on LinkedIn, you may see that a given job has “100+” applicants in less than a day. That’s not a mistake, or a typo.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Just because you see so many applicants doesn’t mean you shouldn’t apply if you’re qualified. You should.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Adding to the difficulty is that many of those 100+ applicants are faking it. It isn’t difficult to create a resume based on the job description. It’s easy to apply, so plenty of unqualified people just go for it. The potential of getting a job is a huge reward for very little effort.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The problem with AI Generated resumes:&lt;/strong&gt; With the popularization of AI, creating and submitting a tailored resume is easier than ever. It will be perfectly formatted, have relevant bullet points, and follow the STAR method.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, you&amp;rsquo;ve got a great process down for developing your code. You&amp;rsquo;ve got great documentation, 100% test coverage, good git branching and tagging, and all the other detailed steps for generating code.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It sure is a lot of typing, though, isn&amp;rsquo;t it? Very repititious. Obviously, you should automate those steps! You&amp;rsquo;re only a little bit away from typing in &amp;ldquo;Write me an app that does X,Y, and Z!&amp;rdquo; and then taking a nap while it does the work!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Not so fast&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>&#34;AI is a bubble!&#34; Yea, So What?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;AI is just a bubble!&amp;rdquo; Yep, sure is. So what? That&amp;rsquo;s no reason to ignore it, or to brush it off as a fad. While nobody can be 100% sure exactly how it will make the world look in five years, you can be sure the world will look different.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Calling something a &amp;ldquo;bubble&amp;rdquo; is often a way to dismiss it. But history shows that even when a bubble pops, the underlying technology doesn&amp;rsquo;t just go away. It sticks around and changes everything.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s been a lot of noise about AI replacing developers. Spoiler: it won&amp;rsquo;t. But your job is changing in ways nobody&amp;rsquo;s really talking about.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;AI isn&amp;rsquo;t going to take your job, it&amp;rsquo;s going to &lt;em&gt;change&lt;/em&gt; your job. There are things you do as part of your job now which will go away, but new parts will be added.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently built a production-ready application entirely with AI assistance, 100% written by the AI - not as a proof-of-concept, but as a functional tool designed to solve complex workflow problems.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;rsquo;t magic, it was work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>AI development: the good and bad</title>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;AI-assisted development accelerates both coding speed and error propagation, with risks like cascading mistakes and design flaws magnified by AI&amp;rsquo;s context limitations, akin to Knight Capital&amp;rsquo;s $500M human-error-driven collapse.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Real-world failures (e.g., Knight Capital) stem from process gaps, not technology; AI intensifies this by compressing multi-year human error patterns - like developers Alice, Bob, and Charlie inheriting undocumented code under time pressure - into hours or days.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;AI lacks persistent context, acting as a &amp;ldquo;new developer&amp;rdquo; per request, which forgets safeguards, amplifies poor documentation, and misses architectural pitfalls unless explicitly guided by experienced oversight.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Defensive coding practices (e.g., explicit error checks, copy-before-move for files) are critical since AI won&amp;rsquo;t self-advocate for safeguards - users must enforce quality control as architects and reviewers.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;While AI democratizes development, inexperienced users often overlook foundational pitfalls, making seasoned judgment essential to prevent small oversights from escalating at machine speed.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>
